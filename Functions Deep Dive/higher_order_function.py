# Introduction to Higher-Order Functions 
# Functions as First-Class Objects 

"""
So far, we have explored the core benefits of using
 functions in our programs. We have seen firsthand how
   using functions allows for better code modularity,
     readability, and extensibility. Many of these benefits
       stem from the ability of functions to be extremely flexible.
         In Python, functions are treated just like any other object,
           which in turn gives them the power to be used in a variety of ways.
             In order to truly understand the power of functions, lets explore
               what it means for functions to be objects!

In Python, all functions, including the ones weve written,
 are classified as first-class objects (sometimes also called first-class
   citizens or first-class functions). This means they have four important
     characteristics:   
     
* First-class objects can be stored as variables.
* First-class objects can be passed as arguments to a function.
* First-class objects can be returned by a function.
* First-class objects can be stored in data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries, etc.).
