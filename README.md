# Python Intermediate Learning Course Summary 
In Learn Intermediate Python 3, I learned how to leverage Python’s unique features and techniques to build powerful, sophisticated applications. and how to expedite my data processing and management, manage my resources, test my code using the Unittest testing framework, and more. Here’s an overview of the courses modules:

* Functions Deep Dive
* Object-Oriented Programming
* Iterators & Generators
* Specialized Collections

## Python Gotcha: Mutable Default Arguments 
Learn about a common Python gotcha when using mutable default arguments in functions! 

## A Python Gotcha!
When writing a function with default arguments, it can sometimes be tempting to include an empty list as a default argument to that function. 

To summarize, I learned:

* What a Python gotcha is.
* What mutable objects are in Python.
* A common gotcha that occurs when using mutable default arguments.
* A workaround for mutable default arguments by using None paired with a conditional statement.

Keep this gotcha in mind whenever deciding to use a mutable object as a default argument. While most developers recommend staying away from this approach, there are notable use cases for this syntax that may be worth looking into!
